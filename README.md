# Wallmart_sales_analytics
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. I utilized Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (PostgreSQL)
Goal: Creating a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

DATA EXPLORATION:
Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
Analysis: Use of functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

 DATA CLEANING:
Remove Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).
Currency Formatting: Use .replace() to handle and format currency values for analysis.
Validation: Checking for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

SQL ANALYSIS: COMPLEX QUERIES AND BUSINESS PROBLEM SOLVING:
Business Problem-Solving: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
Revenue trends across branches and categories.
Identifying best-selling product categories.
Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
Documentation: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.
